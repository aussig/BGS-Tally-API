        Bounty needs to be broken down in multiple events for each of the factions redeemedFor since each event affects only one Faction

        Note: CombatBond is the only PascalCase Type. Recommend using combatBond or combatbond

        Only bounty and CombatBond are really BGS significant, however including all types does not affect the API.
