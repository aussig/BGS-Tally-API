      summary: Post one or more Journal Events
      description: |-
        This endpoint is used to post events that the server has requested via the discovery endpoint. Further, discovery allows the server to request that only events with field values matching specific RegEx.

        Events are batched up to a maximum specified in discovery. An array is expected, even if a single event is sent.

        Each event includes all field values passed directly from the Journal - those game-supplied fields are not included in this documentation. However, Events are also enhanced by BGS-Tally and those enhanced fields are documented below. Those additional fields should be treated as required. An event may still be sent with missing unobtainable fields but is not expected to be processed properly.

      description: |-
        Journal event. Most data is passed directly from the logged event, including Frontier's ideosynchracies and inconsistencies. This is by design for flexibility.

        Additional journal event properties must be included in each event as per Frontier's journal spec for each event type.

        Some events are augmented with additional properties (listed below). Those must be provided to the maximum extend possible for ease of implementation on the server side. If unavailable, an event may be sent with missing augmentations but is not expected to be properly processed.

            The event attribute of the journal event. The default set of events are shown here for brevity, but a server can subscribe to any event that can be logged to the journal.

            Note that requesting some events can cause a lot of traffic to your server, for example FSSSignalDiscovered when entering a large system. Ensure you only request the specific events you need when responding to the discovery endpoint.
